# HRnet

WealthHealth, a large financial company, aims to evolve its internal web application called HRnet, which manages employee records. This application was managed in jQuery on the front-end. The goal was to make it evolve by switching to React. My goal was also to convert a jQuery library to React, and to do so, I chose to convert a calendar library present in HRnet, which is available via [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hugo.delahaye53/react-datepicker).
